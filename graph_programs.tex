\begin{tabular}{lp{10.5cm}}
\ul{Input:} & Any graph $G$. \\
\ul{Output:} & The graph obtained from $G$\/ by marking grey each node and replacing its label $l$\/ with $l{:}i$, where $1 \leq i \leq |V_G|$ is the node's \emph{colour}. The source and target of each non-loop edge have different colours.

\ul{Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-.5ex}
\item The derivation length is bounded by $|V_G|^2$.
\item The program is highly non-deterministic. For the same input graph, it may return outputs with different numbers of colours.
\end{enumerate}
