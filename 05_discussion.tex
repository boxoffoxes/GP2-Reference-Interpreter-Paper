%\subsection{Contributions}

%This work lays a valuable foundation for checking the correctness of subsequent GP2 interpreters and compilers. It also demonstrates the use of a lazy functional language to implement a nondeterministic language. Perhaps the data from running the interpreter on our test programs may reveal some insights into properties/features of the interpreter.
