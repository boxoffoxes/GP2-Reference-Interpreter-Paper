\section{Related and Future Work}
\label{sec:relatedandfuture}

To our knowledge, existing graph-transformation languages do not have published implementations
in the same spirit as our reference interpreter.
For example, GROOVE\cite{Ghamarianetal12} and GrGEN\cite{JakumeitBuchwaldKroll2010}
are two of the most widely used systems.
The Java source code for the GROOVE implementation, including a graphical development suite,
extends to around 150,000 lines.
GrGEN is implemented in a combination of Java and C\#.
A Java front-end is used to generate C\# code and
.NET assemblies from a textual specification of a GrGEN graph rewriting system.
The run-time system and other components are written in C\#. 
In all there are around 68,000 lines of Java source for the front-end,
and around 93,000 lines of C\# for the run-time system, API support and an interactive shell.

We recognise that both GROOVE and GrGEN are mature and fully-featured systems,
and GrGEN in particular is highly optimising.
Even so, the contrast with the 1000-line Haskell sources for our GP2 reference interpreter
is striking.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

%\subsection{Contributions}

%This work lays a valuable foundation for checking the correctness of subsequent GP2 interpreters and compilers. It also demonstrates the use of a lazy functional language to implement a nondeterministic language. Perhaps the data from running the interpreter on our test programs may reveal some insights into properties/features of the interpreter.
