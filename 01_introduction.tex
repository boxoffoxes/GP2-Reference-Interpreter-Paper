\section{Introduction}


The ultimate goal is to produce a compiler for GP2 which can generate machine code that is efficient, both in terms of memory usage and execution time. Due to the highly abstracted and non-deterministic nature of graph programming languages such a compiler may be complex, we decided that in order to have some metric against which the correctness of our compiler could be assessed we would first write a reference interpreter. Our primary goals for this software would be code readability, solution-coverage and correctness, with little regard to performance.
